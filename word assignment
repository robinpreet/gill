The backup file on a backup medium, which can be hard disk, optical disk, shared network folder, USB flash drive, or even another computer on a network.
According to Gonzalez, you should create a system repair disc before backing up your data or system files. When a serious system error has occurred, a system repair disc can repair and restore your operating system to a working state.
When you backup your files, you can either let windows decide what to back up or choose which files to back up by yourself. When Window choose files, Windows will backup data files as well as important system files in a system image. Only choose to select the files yourself if you know exactly which files you need to recover in the event of a system failure.
Once you have selected which files and folders you will back up, you then decide where to back up your files—on optical disc, a hard disk (internal or external), or a network location. You also can choose the frequency, day , and time the backups occur. It is recommended that you back up files weekly. The first time that you use the ‘Set up a backup’ wizard, you will be asked these questions, after which initial backup will be created. The amount of time a backup takes to run depends upon the options you choose. It can take a few minutes to one hour or more
